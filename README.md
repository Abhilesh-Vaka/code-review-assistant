# Code Review Assistant ðŸ¤–

## Objective
[cite_start]This project aims to automate code reviews by analyzing the structure, readability, and best practices of source code files[cite: 51]. [cite_start]It leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide actionable improvement suggestions[cite: 55].

## Scope and Features
* **Input**: Accepts one or more source code files for analysis[cite: 54].
* **Output**: Generates a detailed review report containing suggestions for improvement[cite: 55].
* **Web Interface**: Includes an optional simple dashboard to upload files and view the generated reports[cite: 56].

## Technical Implementation
* **Backend**: A backend API built with Python and Flask receives the code files for processing[cite: 58].
* **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Google's Generative AI to perform the code analysis[cite: 59].
* **Secure API Key Handling**: API keys are loaded from a local `.env` file to prevent exposure in the public repository[cite: 19].

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* A Google API Key for the Gemini API

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this public GitHub repository to your local machine[cite: 6, 8].
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Abhilesh-Vaka/code-review-assistant.git](https://github.com/Abhilesh-Vaka/code-review-assistant.git)
cd code-review-assistant
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment. [cite_start]The project is designed with minimal dependencies as required[cite: 27].

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
To protect sensitive information, the API key must not be hard-coded[cite: 19].

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. [cite_start]This file is intentionally excluded from version control by `.gitignore`[cite: 19].
2.  Add your Google API key to the `.env` file as follows:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

### 5. Run the Application
Start the Flask server with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
The application should now be running without errors at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`[cite: 29].

## How to Use

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  Use the form to select a source code file from your computer.
3.  Click the "Get Review" button.
4.  The review report generated by the LLM will appear on the page.

## Project Deliverables
This submission meets the following deliverable requirements:
* **GitHub Repository**: This public repository on the `main` branch contains all project code and a README file.
